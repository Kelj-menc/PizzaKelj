## About This Laravel "PizzaKelj" Project

Dont look at the name - it doesn't mean anything.

I'll learn Laravel following different online tutorials. At the same time will try to build one real-life application. The idea for the app came from my daughter and hopefully will be launched someday and will help people. For me personally, this project will be successful if we (my daughter and I) spend some quality time together, building and learning new things.

Sorry in advance - I need to say this at the beginning of this journey because I'm a total noob in terms of properly formating and efficiently writing code and generally in the programming world. So if anyone wanna learn how to do things properly, they should leave this place. 


## Instaling Project (for development purposes)
I'll write how I am doing this on my system - win10 64bit, and Visual Studio Code - free source-code editor. Please contribute if you find a better or simpler way to install/clone this or any similar project in your system/environment for development purposes.

installation prerequisites(install on your sistem ):

    1.php (recommended 7+)
    
    2.composer - latest
    
    3.nodejs - latest
    
    4.git - latest
    
    5.xamp (with apache server and MySql)    
    
    
And add them to the path of your system (PHP/composer/npm/git/MySql), so you can use them globally.

--Open the console and cd into the folder where you want to clone the PizzaKelj project and run


    git clone https://github.com/Kelj-menc/PizzaKelj.git
    
--in the new project directory locate ....PizzaKelj\.git\config file (its hidden on my system) open it and
    add this into:
    
    [user]
    email = "your-gitregister-email@example.com"
    name = "Your-Git-Hub_username"
    
Save and close.
    
    
--In the project folder (\PizzaKelj) locate '.env.example' file > make a copy of that file  > past it in the same directory and rename it in a '.env' now open that file with some text editor and change in a DATABASE section 


    DB_DATABASE=pizzakelj
    DB_CONNECTION=mysql

--Fire up xamp and start server and mysql > click on admin(mysql) button > make new database > name:pizzakelj
    
--Open the console and cd into PROJECT folder (/PizzaKelj) and run


    composer update
    
next run

    PHP artisan key:generate
    
and finally

    php artisan migrate

--Open the console and cd into PROJECT folder (/PizzaKelj) and run
    php artisan serve
