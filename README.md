## About This Laravel Project

I'll learn Laravel following diferent online tutorials. In a same time will try to build one real life application. Idea for the app came from my doughter and hopefully will be lounched some day and will help people. For me personally this project will be successuful if we (my doughter and I) spend some quality time togeather bulding and learning new things.

Sorry in advance - I need to say this at the begining of this jurnej becouse I'm total noob in terms of properly formating and eficiently writing code and generally in programing world. So if anyone wanna learn how to do things properly should leave this place.
